# ✈️ AirlineDB Database Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📝 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing the **AirlineDB relational database**, which models real-world airline booking and flight management operations.

The database includes information about bookings, tickets, passengers, flights, airports, aircrafts, boarding passes, and seat configurations.

The objective of this project was to perform structured SQL analysis to understand flight operations, passenger bookings, aircraft utilization, and seat allocation.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

* Analyze booking and ticket distribution
* Understand flight connectivity and segments
* Evaluate aircraft seat configurations and travel classes
* Analyze airport and route-level data
* Ensure seat allocation integrity (no duplicate seat assignment)
* Study flight frequency based on departure dates

---

## 🗂️ Database Structure

The database consists of the following key tables:

* Bookings
* Tickets
* Ticket_Flights
* Flights
* Airports
* Aircrafts
* Seats
* Boarding_Passes

The schema represents a real-world airline reservation and check-in system with proper relational connections.
